# What is three.js?

It is, according to their github page, "a lightweight 3D library with a very low
 level of complexity â€” in other words, for dummies."

 It's also extremely vast, though, and there are all kinds of amazing projects
 that can be made.

## Dependencies

Install with `npm install` so that you'll be able to run grunt serve to see
your images on local host!

## What can three.js do?

It is a library that's meant to make rendering 3D images to browsers easier. It
works with rendering APIs such as WebGL, except using three.js means
much, much less code!

(as for WebGL, what's that? it's a Javascript API that accesses the computer's
GPU and renders 2 and 3D interactive graphics to compatible browsers'
canvas element.)

But since it's tool for graphics, let's actually look at some examples (selected
from threejs.org):

## Let's build a basic program!

Fair warning: it's not going to look 1/100th as cool as the examples I just
showed you, but it's a way to take a look at the most basic elements of a
three.js script.
